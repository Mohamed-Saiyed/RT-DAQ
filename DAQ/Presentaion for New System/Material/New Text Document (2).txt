*1.Time Resultion is constant can be calcualted in the initilize state.
*2.The Timing over flow Handling mechanism can be handled better than this instead
of making a sepreate function and calling it in the superloop.
*3.Hardware registers can be accessed by using Hal API's.
*4.All this caluclation can be done out of intterupt and the intterupt
is just used to capture the the timing values.
5.there is an overall better design.
	5.1 Don't use extern keyword instead use getter functions.
	5.2 statcic keyword is not used in filescoped variables.
*6.If the metal is not symetrical there will be an issues so we can 
take 4 inputs and calcualate the average of all of them.
*7.if the two sensros in the rare wheels don't matter so we can 
Dispense them, but when the car is slipping we can include them in the speed
average calculations to get more accurate readings.
8.if the two rare wheels' RPM is less priority so we can send the CAN message as follows
FRONT_LEFT_RPM | FRONT_RIGHT_RPM | SPEED;
